*This applications purpose is to simulate the functionality of a Hotel Rezervation tool.*

### In this project you can see:
* OOP principles 
* the use of **JAVA Lists** and **JAVA Sets** 
* the use of a **sorting algorithm** to sort the reservations alphabetically by name 
* a *data base* (simple file) will be created automatically***(hotel.db)** when the app is closed. This will ensure that all the reservations make will not be lost next time you open the app. This process is made using **JAVA serialization**.

### The scenario taken into consideration is: 
* The app will be used from the receptionist perspective.
* 1 Hotel
* 10 Rooms 
* Reservations can be made on every date but the Rooms nr are choose automatically (from 0 to 9).
